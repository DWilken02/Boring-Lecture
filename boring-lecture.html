    <h1>I"m not interested in history</h1>
    <h2>It just does not catch my eye</h2>

    <p class="intro">Every time i was in history class I tended to have my mind on other things and not what was being taught.</p>

    <h3>Here are my actual interests</h3>

    <p class="outro">I love computer science because not only do I get to learn about computers but I also get to play around with all the commands and code when learning</p>
